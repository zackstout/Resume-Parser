# Resume Parser

Let's brainstorm here? I guess? Maybe we should have a google doc. Anyway I like Emma's idea of using an image-processing API since that would mean we could treat every kind of file the same: take a picture of it (somehow), and then analyze that image.

That being said, some cursory digging has turned up a few libraries that might be good alternatives:
- [pdf2json](https://github.com/modesty/pdf2json)
- [pdf.js](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/405/how-to-convert-pdf-to-text-extract-text-from-pdf-with-javascript)
- [docx templater](https://docxtemplater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#browser)

I haven't dived into any of these yet but I am heartened that our choices abound.
